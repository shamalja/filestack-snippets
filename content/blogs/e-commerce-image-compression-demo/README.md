## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/fileschool/filestack-snippets.git
cd filestack-snippets/content/blogs/e-commerce-image-compression-demo
```

### 2️⃣ Open the project

You can run the HTML file locally:

	- Simply double-click index.html, or
	- Use a local dev server (e.g., VS Code’s Live Server extension).

### 3️⃣ Add your Filestack API key

In the script section of `index.html`, replace the placeholder with your real API key:

`const client = filestack.init('YOUR_API_KEY');`

You can get your API key from the Filestack Developer Dashboard after [signing up](https://www.filestack.com/signup-start/) for a free Filestack account.

## 🧠 Example Transformation

The optimized image URLs use Filestack’s transformation syntax:

`https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=width:600,fit:max/compress/output=format:webp,quality:80/FILE_HANDLE`

  - resize=width:600 → Resizes the image to 600px wide
    
	- compress → Reduces file size efficiently
    
	- output=format:webp,quality:80 → Converts to WebP format with 80% quality
